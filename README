# cse180_project
This program is a tool that can perform several differential expression analysis pipelines.  

Differential expression analysis or RNA-seq attempts to identify the genes that are differentially expressed in
distinct groups of samples.  Usually in a differential expression analysis we have a control sample, which is a 
commonly a healthy sample under normal conditions, and we used that sample as a comparison for our experimental
sample, which is under different circumstances from the control sample. The samples are obtained by taking a snapshot
of the levels of mRNA in both the control and experimental specimens. By studying the levels of mRNA, we are able to
identify which genes were differentially expressed at a given time, which may lead to a variety of biological insight. 

To run this program, users must input their data (control and experimental samples) in the form of fastq files and 
can choose between the following RNA-seq pipelines:

1. Tophat + Cufflinks + Cuffdiff

2. STAR + Deseq

The program will run whichever pipeline the user specified, or executes the Tophat + Cufflinks + Cuffdiff pipeline
by default.
